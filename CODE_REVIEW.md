## CRITICAL

### 1. Supabase credentials in git history
**Status:** Mitigated. Keys have been rotated in the Supabase dashboard, and `git filter-repo` was run to strip `.env` from all history, followed by a force-push of `main` and every feature branch. The old initial commit (`858fe0c`) is no longer reachable from any ref.

Caveat: GitHub does not immediately garbage-collect unreferenced commits. The old SHA may still be resolvable via the REST API for some time. Since the exposed key is already rotated and dead, this is low-risk. To fully evict, contact GitHub Support to trigger an expedited GC.

Original finding: commit `858fe0c` contained a `.env` file with real credentials (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`). The file was deleted in a later commit but was permanently recoverable via `git show 858fe0c:.env`.

### 2. No Row Level Security (RLS) on `comments` table
**Status:** In PR #15 (stacked on PR #9). Adds `supabase/migrate-enable-rls.sql` that enables RLS on both tables with no policies — anon/public roles are denied everything by default. API functions are switched to read `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (a small follow-up was pushed to PR #8 so both API handlers use the same var name). README documents the new setup and the rule that the service-role key must never be inlined into the client bundle.

`supabase/schema.sql` — no `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, no policies. Anyone with the anon key can `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` all comments across all projects. Zero tenant isolation.

**Action:** Enable RLS and add policies scoped by `project_id`.

## HIGH

### 3. `GET /api/comments` endpoint does not exist
**Status:** In PR #8.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:68` fetches `${API_BASE}/comments?projectId=...` on mount, but only `api/comment.ts` (POST) exists. The sidebar is always empty on page load — comments only appear if submitted in the current session. The error is silently swallowed.

**Action:** Create `api/comments.ts` to handle the GET.

### 4. README documents non-existent props
**Status:** In PR #9 (folded into the `apiBase` PR so docs match code on merge).

`README.md` shows `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` as props, but `FeedbackWidget` only accepts `projectId`. Those props are silently ignored. Users following the README get a false sense of controlling their data destination.

**Action:** Either implement the props or update the README to match the actual API.

### 5. Hardcoded API URL in distributed package
**Status:** In PR #9. `apiBase` is now a **required** prop; no default. Demo reads `VITE_API_BASE` and `VITE_PROJECT_ID` from env.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx` — `apiBase` is now a required prop. Consumers must point it to their own TDP deployment.

**Action:** Expose `API_BASE` as a configurable prop.

### 6. `setSending(false)` runs before fetch resolves — duplicate submissions
**Status:** In PR #10. Uses a synchronous `sendingRef` guard, awaits the fetch, and gates optimistic UI on HTTP success.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:181-216` — the `fetch` is fire-and-forget, and `setSending(false)` runs synchronously after it. The "Send" button is re-enabled instantly, allowing users to spam-submit the same comment.

**Action:** Await the fetch and flip `sending` after the response (or on error).

### 7. No auth, rate limiting, or size limits on the API
**Status:** Open.

`api/comment.ts` — anyone can POST arbitrarily large payloads to any `projectId` with no authentication. Combined with missing RLS, the database can be trivially spammed or exhausted.

**Action:** Add rate limiting, input size caps, and consider a shared secret or signed request scheme.

### 8. `x`/`y` not validated as numbers
**Status:** In PR #14 — splits the check into presence of required string fields plus a `typeof 'number' && Number.isFinite` check for `x`/`y`. Rejects with a clean 400. Range validation (0–100 for percentages) is out of scope here — belongs to item #7.

`api/comment.ts:22-28` — only checks `x == null || y == null`, not that they are numeric. Non-numeric values will cause a Postgres type error, and the raw error message is leaked to the caller (`error.message` on line 51).

**Action:** Validate `typeof x === 'number' && Number.isFinite(x)` (and same for `y`) before inserting.

## MEDIUM

### 9. CORS headers missing on 405 and 500 early-return responses
**Status:** Open.

`api/comment.ts:19` and `:34` — the `cors` headers are applied to 200/400/500 responses but not to the 405 (wrong method) or the misconfiguration 500. Browsers will block these error responses cross-origin, hiding real error messages.

### 10. `sent` state is dead code
**Status:** In PR #11.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:51` — `setSent(true)` is never called. The `!sent` condition on line 428 is always true. Likely a leftover from an earlier submission-confirmation flow. Either wire it up or remove it.

### 11. Dead ternary inside `!sidebarOpen` guard
**Status:** In PR #11.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:671-677` — the trigger button is only rendered when `!sidebarOpen`, but the style computes `right: sidebarOpen ? 344 : 24`. Since `sidebarOpen` is always `false` here, the ternary is dead code.

### 12. `src/lib/supabase.ts` is unused dead code
**Status:** In PR #11.

Never imported anywhere. The singleton also has a subtle bug: subsequent calls with different credentials silently return the first client. Remove the file, or use it and fix the cache key.

### 13. `@supabase/supabase-js` bundled into library output
**Status:** In PR #12 — defensive externalization in `vite.config.ts`. Tree-shaking already keeps it out today since nothing reachable from `src/index.ts` imports it, so the fix guards against a future accidental import rather than correcting current output.

`vite.config.ts:19` — React is externalized but Supabase is not, so the entire Supabase client is compiled into the dist bundle. Since the widget uses the Vercel API (not Supabase directly), this dependency is unused bloat.

**Action:** Add `@supabase/supabase-js` to `rollupOptions.external`, or remove the dependency entirely.

### 14. Supabase error messages forwarded to clients
**Status:** Open.

`api/comment.ts:51` — `error.message` can contain schema details (table names, constraints). Return a generic error and log internally.

## LOW

### 15. Unused `fw-pop` keyframe
**Status:** In PR #11.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:779` — defined but never referenced.

### 16. `peerDependencies` says React 18, dev uses React 19
**Status:** In PR #11.

`package.json` — should be `"^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"` to avoid spurious peer dep warnings in React 19 projects.

### 17. `plan.md` schema does not match actual schema
**Status:** Open.

`plan.md` still describes `project_id` as UUID with FK, but it was migrated to `text` (see `supabase/migrate-project-id-to-text.sql`).

### 18. Misleading comment
**Status:** In PR #13 — comment dropped.

`src/components/FeedbackWidget.tsx:218` — says "Show eye button with blue ring" but the button actually shows a red X in selecting mode.

### 19. `INVALID_CLASS_CHARS` name/comment is misleading
**Status:** In PR #13 — renamed to `INVALID_IDENT_CHARS`, comment updated to note it applies to both ids and classes.

`src/lib/getSelector.ts:1-2` — used for both ID and class validation, not just classes. Rename or adjust the comment.

## Recommended priority

1. Rotate the leaked Supabase keys immediately — they are permanently in git history.
2. Enable RLS on the `comments` table.
3. Create the `GET /api/comments` endpoint — the sidebar is non-functional without it.
4. Make `API_BASE` configurable via props and fix the README to match the actual API.
5. Await the fetch in `handleSend` so the sending state is meaningful and duplicates are prevented.
6. Add basic validation (numeric `x`/`y`, string length limits) to the API endpoint.
